# Package example 

Execute 
```Bash
$> pip install . 
```
After setting the venv. 

This will create in vene directory/bin an executable with the name described in **entry_points**

Easyer way in order to avoid writinf setup.py is to install: 
```Bash
$> pip install setup-py-upgrade
$> setup-py-upgrade .
./setup.py and ./setup.cfg written!
```
Going futher:
```Bash
$> pip install setup-cfg-fmt
$> setup-cfg-fmt setup.cfg
Rewriting setup.cfg
```
